## Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All email processing happens locally on your machine
- **No Email Sending**: Application only reads emails and generates drafts
- **Secure Connections**: Uses SSL/TLS for all email connections

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
- Verify you're using an **App Password**, not your Gmail password
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Check IMAP is enabled in Gmail settings

### API Errors
- Verify Gemini API key is correct
- Check API quota limits in Google AI Studio
- Ensure you have access to Gemini 2.0

### No Emails Found
- Check for unread emails in your inbox
- Adjust "Days Back" setting
- Verify email filters aren't auto-marking emails as read

## Best Practices

- **Never commit credentials** to version control
- **Regularly rotate** API keys and App Passwords
- **Review AI responses** before sending
- **Use environment variables** for production deployments
- **Revoke unused** App Passwords periodically
